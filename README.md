RDMA Kernel Module for High-Performance Interconnects

Overview

This repository contains a Linux kernel module that demonstrates the implementation of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) communication. The module is designed to showcase my expertise in Linux kernel development, particularly in the areas relevant to a Software Engineer - Linux Kernel Engineer role at Meta.

Features

RDMA Integration: Sets up and manages RDMA components, including Protection Domains, Queue Pairs, and Completion Queues.
High-Performance Communication: Optimized for low-latency, high-throughput communication, crucial for scalable and efficient system performance.
Cross-Platform Support: Designed with the flexibility to support multi-platform environments and embedded systems.
Resource Management: Demonstrates the handling of kernel-level resources, including memory management and device interaction.
Installation

To build and install the kernel module:

bash
Kopier kode
make
sudo insmod rdma_module.ko
To remove the module:

bash
Kopier kode
sudo rmmod rdma_module
Usage

Once loaded, the module sets up the necessary RDMA resources. It is designed to be extendable for more complex RDMA operations, making it a suitable base for developing high-performance interconnect solutions.
