RDMA Kernel Module for High-Performance Interconnects

Overview

This repository contains a Linux kernel module that demonstrates the implementation of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) communication.

Features

RDMA Integration: Sets up and manages RDMA components, including Protection Domains, Queue Pairs, and Completion Queues.
High-Performance Communication: Optimized for low-latency, high-throughput communication, crucial for scalable and efficient system performance.
Cross-Platform Support: Designed with the flexibility to support multi-platform environments and embedded systems.
Resource Management: Demonstrates the handling of kernel-level resources, including memory management and device interaction.
Installation

To build and install the kernel module:

bash
copy code
make
sudo insmod rdma_module.ko
To remove the module:

bash
copy copy
sudo rmmod rdma_module
Usage

Once loaded, the module sets up the necessary RDMA resources. It is designed to be extendable for more complex RDMA operations, making it a suitable base for developing high-performance interconnect solutions.
